4 Pillars of OOP
1-Encapsulation:
   -> Hides data using private/protected access modifiers.
   -> Uses getters and setters for controlled access.

2- Abstraction:
  -> Hides complex implementation details.
  -> Only exposes essential functionalities via interfaces/abstract classes.
  -> Reduces complexity and increases reusability.

3- Inheritance 
  -> Enables code reuse by creating child classes from a parent class.
  -> Supports hierarchical relationships (BaseClass → DerivedClass).
  -> Promotes polymorphism and maintainability.

4- Polymorphism:
  -> Allows methods to have multiple forms (overloading & overriding).
  -> Method Overriding (runtime polymorphism) → Parent & child class methods.
  -> Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism) → Same method, different parameters.
